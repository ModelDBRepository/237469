    Python and NEURON scripts (NEURON is freely available from <a href="http://neuron.yale.edu">https://neuron.yale.edu</a>) for running network simulations of layer V pyramidal cells (L5PCs). This ModelDB entry includes two directories each of which contains a readme with usage instructions:
  <p/>
<pre>
approxhaynet # The main directory with the Python and HOC scripts for simulating the network of L5PCs. Includes files for simulations
             # with both stationary and oscillatory Poisson background inputs.
haymod       # An auxiliary directory with similar content as our ModelDB entry 169457. Includes scripts for scaling the variants,
             # calculating the f-I curves and prepulse-inhibition windows
</pre>
<p/>
The codes have been tested on macOS 10.13.3 running Python 2.7.14 and NEURON 7.5 and Linux 2.6.32-696.18.7.el6.centos.plus.x86_64
running Python 2.7.3, NEURON 7.4 and 7.5 (the LFP simulations cannot be run using NEURON 7.4), and mpirun (Open MPI) 1.6.2.
